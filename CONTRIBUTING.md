At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests
within three business days (and, typically, one business day). We may suggest
some changes, improvements or alternatives.

## Testing

We have a few automated tests, please run them against any changes you would like to submit. If your changes are significant, please consider how a new test might validate that the new behavior works correctly and does not break any preexisting behavior. Just like the software they validate, tests are always evolving. If you see one that you think is based on invalid assumptions, let us know!
